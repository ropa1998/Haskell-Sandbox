# Haskell Practice

This is a set of exercises and their implementations in Haskell for the course "Programming Languages" at Universidad Austral.

##How to Use
First of all remember to have GHC installed in your system. If you don't, please download it from [here](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

After that you must link and compile files in order to compile them, just as you would in C.

```ghc -o hello hello.hs ```

After that you would just need to run the hello exe, which depending on your system runs differently.

```./hello``` in Unix based systems will do the trick. Otherwise, use ```hello.exe```

If you want a more detailed version of these instructions, please go [here](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_5_steps#Install_Haskell).

I hope you find it useful!
